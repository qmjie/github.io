This is an exciting things for me!  I refer to the posts of [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/),it really is so great! Thank you very much!

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

heihei!
